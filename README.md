1312ru Stealer

# A simple leak of this stealer that start to show up on as lot of python program as dualhook

The stealer is hidden inside a lot of program, fake stealer, fake tools etc.. using the ; technique.

```py
import requests                                                                ;exec("code")
```

It is doing requests.get() to a website and remove tag to get the code hidden inside of the fake Cloudflare blocked webpage

The stealer seem original, but still pretty bad, nothing very advanced

If at one point you feel like "using" it, don't, it is shit
