  <summary>1312 Stealer</summary>

## A simple leak of this stealer that start to show up on as lot of python program as dualhook

The stealer is hidden inside a lot of program, fake stealer, fake tools etc.. using the ; technique.

```py
import requests                                                                ;exec("code")
```

It is doing requests.get() to a website and remove tag to get the code hidden inside of the fake Cloudflare blocked webpage

The stealer seem original, but still pretty bad, nothing very advanced

What it steal : 

- Browser data (History, Cookies, Password and more!)
- Telegram files
- Discord token

- It inject a modified asar file on Exodus

- It search on the whole computer for these
- Passwords and Account Information:
  file with those name: passw, mdp, motdepasse, mot_de_passe, login, secret, account, acount, paypal, banque, compte
  Cryptocurrency and Security:
  - metamask, wallet, crypto, exodus, 2fa, token, backup, memo, seecret
  Communication and Miscellaneous:
  -discord, code

  It check if the file exist and then verify if the extension is :
  Text and Document Files:
    - .txt, .log, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .pdf, .rtf, .json, .csv, .db
  Image and Video Files:
   -  .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .webp, .mp4

And even more data !

 If at one point you feel like "using" it, don't, it is shit
